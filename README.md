This is a game inspired by Worlds Hardest Game.

It was a project I did in highschool so there are some "features" in the game (aka bugs).
For example, I realised that it is quite hard to write collision detecton in a good way.

Anyhow, you need to run the file WHG.java to start the game. (I will probably wrap it in a .jar file at some point)
